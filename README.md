Backend API Development

Building a RESTful Blogging API

Objective:
Develop a RESTful API for a blogging platform using Node.js. Your API should manage Users, Blogs, and Comments, demonstrating your ability to implement complex logical relationships and data storage using RESTful principles.

Requirements: Node JS, Express JS, and any database with sample data

Models:
User: Represents individuals who can create blogs and comments.
Blog: Created by a User. Other users can comment on these blogs.
Comment: Can be made by any User on any Blog.
Implement relationships between these models (e.g., Users can author multiple Blogs and Comments; Blogs can have multiple Comments).

Database Implementation:
Implement a database using a technology of your choice.
Populate it with sample data for Users, Blogs, and Comments.

Functionality:
Implement CRUD operations for each model.
Include routes for additional functionalities like viewing all blogs/comments by a user, etc.
Ensure proper validation and error handling.

Documentation:
Create a README file that explains how to set up and use your API.
Document the API endpoints, including the expected request and response formats.

Deployment and Submission:
Deploy your API on any cloud platform.
Provide a live link to the deployed API for testing purposes.


Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: All API endpoints must work correctly with logical relationships between models.
Code Quality: Clean, modular, and well-documented code.
Deployment: Successful deployment and functionality of the API in a live environment.
